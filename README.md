# Ghost vs Hunters

## Description
Ghost vs Hunters is a simulation of a ghost hunt in a multi-room environment, where four hunters equipped with devices search for three kinds of evidence left behind by a ghost. This project was developed using C, Valgrind, and Linux and demonstrates the ability to write multi-threaded code to improve the performance and efficiency of applications.

## Features

* Multi-room environment where hunters can move between rooms to search for evidence
* Four hunters equipped with devices that can detect different types of evidence
* Ghost AI that moves between rooms and leaves behind evidence
* Evidence sharing among hunters to increase the chances of finding all evidence
* Determination of a winner based on which team collects all three types of evidence first
